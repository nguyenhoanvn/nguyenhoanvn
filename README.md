## About Me

I’m a Software Engineering student with a strong focus on **backend development** and **system design**.  
I enjoy building **scalable, maintainable web applications** and designing backend systems that are clean, reliable, and easy to evolve.

I’m especially interested in:
- Writing **clean, readable, and testable code**
- Applying **clean architecture & design patterns**
- Turning real-world problems into practical software solutions

I learn best by building, experimenting, and continuously refining my approach.

## Pet Project
My pet project is [MeetCode](https://github.com/nguyenhoanvn/MeetCode), I was thinking of, what happens if I add gamification into our everyday practicing code. In this project, problems solving aside, I demand user can matchmaking with other, into a 1v1 game, and whoever submit faster, with better code quality (which can be judged based on time complexity and memory usage). But that's just the idea, I just completed the executing code by combining between RabbitMq for message enqueuing, SignalR for front end and back end job communication and Docker for code executing.<br><br>
**You can check out the project here, on Azure:**<br>
