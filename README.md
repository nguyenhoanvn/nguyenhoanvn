<h3 align="left">ðŸ“š My Code Journey</h3>
<p align="left">
  My programming journey began with curiosity and a passion for building things that make an impact. Over the years, Iâ€™ve explored various languages and technologies, from low-level C programming to modern frameworks like Spring Boot, .NET, and databases like SQL Server and MySQL.

  <ul>
    <li><b>11/2023:</b> Wrote my first Hello World program in C. My first course was CS50 of Havard University. That course was a life changing course, it gave me overview of the Computer Science world, and also a foundation of coding/development.</li>
    <li><b>02/2024:</b> My first OOP program is complete. It's an Order Management System, a console app allows user to perform CRUD operations.</li>
    <li><b>08/2024:</b> First time touching database, it's a bit hard at the start, but in the end I managed to understand it. During this time, I also got to know Data Structure such as Tree, Graph, HashMap, Stack, and Queue.</li>
    <li><b>01/2025:</b> My first Internet Of Things project is completed, it's an alarm clock using Arduino Uno as its microcontroller, LED matrix 8x32 as the screen, I can also use bluetooth signal to control its display string, set timezone by using the HC-05 module.</li>
    <li><b>05/2025:</b> My university-mates invited me to work on a Spring Boot project called Edutrack, they are awesome people, both as colleagues and friends. I always strive my best to catch on them. Currently at 5th July 2025, our project is about to complete.</li>
  </ul>

  Through each stage, Iâ€™ve learned not just to code, but to solve problems, collaborate, and keep adapting. My journey is ongoingâ€”Iâ€™m excited for every new challenge, and always striving to grow as a developer.
