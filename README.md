## About Me

I’m a Software Engineering student with a strong focus on **backend development** and **system design**.  
I enjoy building **scalable, maintainable web applications** and designing backend systems that are clean, reliable, and easy to evolve.

I’m especially interested in:
- Writing **clean, readable, and testable code**
- Applying **clean architecture & design patterns**
- Turning real-world problems into practical software solutions

I learn best by building, experimenting, and continuously refining my approach.
